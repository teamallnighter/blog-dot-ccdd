This is an web application I made for our family business. The app takes in data on the back end via forestry.io and turns it into a proposal for potential customers.

They needed something that would be easy for their staff to generate the proposal and have a custom link to send to the customer. With Forestry, they just need to fill out the form and boom! in minutes they have a really nice looking proposal.
